## Solution

We are given the following string `oujp{xkurpjcxah_ljnbja_lryqna}`.

It's clear that this is some type of simple ROT cypher, both from pattern recongintion in the string and the fact the challenge name is spin. 

Using decode.fr we can identify that its a +9 ROT cypher and decode the flag `flag{obligatory_caesar_cipher}`.
